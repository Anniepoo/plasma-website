The Plasma programming language strikes a balance between functional and
imperative programming,
making it easier to write reliable and efficient software.
Plasma is <b>under development</b> and is not usable yet.
Its planned features include:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Declaratively pure</dt>
<dd>helping programmers more confidently understand their
programs, making debugging easier.
Purity also makes it easier to apply many optimisations including automatic
parallelisation.
Plasma uses a <i>resource</i> system to make effects safe.
Resources are composable unlike monads.
</dd>
<dt>A strong, static type system</dt>
<dd>supporting ADTs, parametric polymorphism and type inference.</dd>
<dt>Direct support for loops</dt>
<dd>for map, reduce, filter and combinations.
Loops work on different aggregate types.
</dd>
<dt>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</dt>
<dd>Interoperability with C.
<dt>Multiple concurrency abstractions</dt>
<dd>Tasks, channels, mvars, futures and STM.
<dt>Manual and automatic parallelisation</dt>
<dd>Parallelise programs based on data-flow, loops and possibly pipelines eithe
by adding annotations or automatically.

<h2>Tell me more</h2>

<p>
For some early details about the language, it's syntax and semantics take a
look at the
<a href="docs/plasma_ref.html">Plasma Language Reference</a>
and the rest of the <a href="docs/">documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<p>
The project is in its very early stages.
Feel free to follow along on via
<a href="{{ site.contact_page }}">Mailing lists, IRC or Social Media</a>.
