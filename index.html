The Plasma Programming language aims to be a general purpose programming
language suited to parallel and concurrent programming.
Plasma will use a strong static type system and referential transparency to
make it easier to develop and maintain large programs.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>
Development has started only recently (July 2015) and we're not ready to
discuss many design decisions.
However some vague details are provided here to get the hype train rolling.
</p>

<p>
Plasma language:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaratively pure (referential transparency)</li>
<li>Strong static type system supporting:
  <ul>
  <li>Discriminated unions</li>
  <li>Algebraic types</li>
  <li>Other things</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Straight-forward FFI aimed towards C APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>
Plasma implementation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Compiles to an abstract machine representation</li>
<li>Abstract machine has bytecode and textual representations</li>
<li>The first version will execute the bytecode kind-of directly (details
later)</li>
<li>Later versions may compile the bytecode to assembly/machine code and/or
LLVM</li>
<li>Open source</li>
</ul>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>
We intend to measure our progress based on these kinds of milestones, in
approximate order.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Hello World compiles and executes</li>
<li>Basic runtime: very simple GC</li>
<li>Self hosting ready</li>
<li>Bootstraps</li>
<li>Runtime system improvements</li>
<li>Basic Parallelism and Concurrency</li>
<li>Optimisations</li>
<li>Improved code generation / extra backend targets</li>
<li>Improved Garbage Collection</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<dl>
<dt>What is it written in?
<dd><a href="http://mercurylang.org">Mercury</a>,
until it can be bootstrapped, then hopefully Plasma

<dt>You work on <a href="http://mercurylang.org">Mercury</a> already,
so is this Mercury 2.0?
<dd>No.  It's more like a compromise between declarative languages and
imperative (more familiar) languages.  It is not a logic programming
language.

<dt>Why are you writing it?
<dd>A few reasons.
The main one is that I feel as if I haven't done anything "cool"
computer-science wise since finishing my Ph.D.
(Automatic Parallelism for Mercury)
and would like to do more of that kind of thing.
I also love purely-declarative programming but Haskell and Mercury can be
quite difficult to learn.
Therefore I'd like to create a compromise, a language that has many of the
cool things about declarative programming, without some of the super-abstract
or otherwise unfriendly features of these languages.
I also have some exciting plans for parallelism and concurrency, but that's
a secret.

<dt>Why the name Plasma?
<dd>It's a secret for now, until then I'll say that I'm referring to the
fourth state of matter.

<dt>What paradigm is it?
<dd>Technically it will be a functional language,
however it will look more like a procedural language and be familiar to
more people

<dt>What is the intended purpose?  Web programming / scripting / systems?
<dd>I really don't like these separations.
A good language with a good implementation should be suitable in many
environments.

<dt>Will it have a Javascript/Ruby/X backend?
<dd>I would prefer to have fewer backends to maintain.
Therefore I will concentrate on the two backends that I have planned:
bytecode and native code (or LLVM).
However, a bytecode intermediate format allows other developers to write
bytecode interpreters (or translators) for their favorite environments.
eg: the JVM.

<dt>Why are you letting that old man hold you while you code?
<dd>Because I'm only 12 weeks old and can't sit up by myself yet

Coming soon.

I'm considering financial donations in addition to the usual code,
documentation and such.

<p>
I'm also interested in talking to a graphic artist who can donate some
graphics for the website, such as a banner and a logo.
I have something in mind but if someone else can draw it that would be
great.
